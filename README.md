# cyouapitestframework
It's a light-wight test framework use to test http restful API.

You can write case into excel, the framework will load all test cases from specfic path on the config file. Then test runner will run these test cases on by on.
At least html report gen model will generate a html report.

If you want to use it, just change your project config to config\config.ini, then change testhost.py to load config path from command(Now the config path is hard code).
